Well-known techniques based on center of mass calculation, image registration, or reconstruction evaluation work well under favourable conditions but they fail in cases where samples are larger than field of view, when the projections show low signal-to-noise, or when optical defects dominate the contrast. Here we propose an alternative technique which is based on the Fourier analysis of the sinogram. Our technique shows excellent performance particularly on challenging data.},}
